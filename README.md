# UT Tenant Savings Dashboard

Pulls generation/battery/grid data from each property's Fox ESS inverter (Fox Open
API) and shows tenants their solar/battery/grid usage split and bill savings.

Full spec: [`docs/UT_Tenant_Dashboard_Spec.md`](docs/UT_Tenant_Dashboard_Spec.md).

## Status

Build order (spec §10):

- [x] 1. Scaffold repo, Postgres schema, deploy skeleton
- [ ] 2. Fox OAuth flow for one test device
- [ ] 3. Poller for one device
- [ ] 4. Nightly rollup job + cost calculation
- [ ] 5. Dashboard API + minimal frontend
- [ ] 6. Multi-tenant isolation (second/third property)
- [ ] 7. Onboarding flow at scale
- [ ] 8. Organizations model + HA/LA portfolio view
- [ ] 9. Agreements/consent_records sign-up flow

## Stack

Node.js + TypeScript, Express, Postgres (`pg`), deployed on Render (`render.yaml`).
See spec §3 for rationale.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # set DATABASE_URL to a local/managed Postgres instance
npm run migrate         # applies migrations/*.sql
npm run dev              # starts the API on PORT (default 3000)
```

`GET /health` checks the process is up and the DB is reachable.

## Database

Plain SQL migrations in `migrations/`, applied in filename order and tracked in a
`schema_migrations` table (`npm run migrate`, `src/db/migrate.ts`). No ORM — kept
deliberately simple for pilot scale (§2, §3).

`001_init.sql` creates the pilot-scope tables from spec §5: `properties`,
`meter_readings`, `daily_rollups`. The HA/LA portfolio tables (`organizations`,
`organization_users`, `agreements`, `consent_records` — spec §9a) are deferred to
build-order steps 8-9.

## Deploy

`render.yaml` is a Render Blueprint: one web service + one managed Postgres
database. Background worker/cron services for the token refresher, poller, and
nightly rollup job (spec §6) get added once those jobs exist (steps 2-4).
